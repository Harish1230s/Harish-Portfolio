## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Harish Kumar Sarathi, a graduate student at UT Dallas, specializing in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. I’m passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights and building intelligent, scalable systems using both classical analytics and modern cloud-native tools.

With a background in electronics and IoT, and hands-on experience across Python, R, SQL, AWS, and Power BI, I’ve built data science solutions that range from customer behavior prediction to cloud-based data platforms. I thrive at the intersection of problem-solving, experimentation, and business value creation - and I’m actively looking for opportunities to bring that energy into real-world data teams.
